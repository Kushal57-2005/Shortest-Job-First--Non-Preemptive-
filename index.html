              First Come, First Serve (FCFS) is one of the simplest types of CPU
              scheduling algorithms. It is exactly what it sounds like:
              processes are attended to in the order in which they arrive in the
              ready queue, much like customers lining up at a grocery store.

              Shortest Job First(Non Preemptive) is a CPU scheduling algorithm
              where the process with the shortest burst time is selected next.
              Once a process starts execution, it cannot be interrupted until it
              finishes.

              Shortest Job First (Preemptive) is a CPU scheduling algorithm
              where the process with the shortest remaining burst time is
              selected for execution. Unlike the non-preemptive version, a
              currently running process can be interrupted if a new process
              arrives with a shorter remaining execution time.

              Round Robin Scheduling is a method used by operating systems to
              manage the execution time of multiple processes that are competing
              for CPU attention. It is called "round robin" because the system
              rotates through all the processes, allocating each of them a fixed
              time slice or "quantum", regardless of their priority.

              Non-preemptive priority scheduling selects the highest-priority
              process from the ready queue for execution. Once a process starts
              running, it continues until completion without interruption, even
              if a higher-priority process arrives later. Priority is assigned
              based on system requirements such as resource usage and execution
              importance.

              Preemptive priority scheduling selects the highest-priority
              process from the ready queue for execution. If a process with
              higher priority arrives while another is running, the CPU preempts
              the current process and allocates the CPU to the higher-priority
              process. Priority is assigned based on system requirements such as
              resource usage and execution importance.
