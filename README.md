# 🖥️ Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm - Non-Preemptive

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** CPU Scheduling algorithm in a web-based interface. The **non-preemptive** version is used here—once a process starts, it runs to completion without interruption.

**SJF** selects the process with the shortest burst time next. It helps minimize average waiting time and turnaround time, making it efficient for batch jobs with predictable durations.

## 🚀 Features

* 📥 User input for number of processes, arrival time, and burst time
* 🧠 Calculates:

  * Completion Time
  * Turnaround Time
  * Waiting Time
  * 📊 Displays results in a clean table format
  * 📉 Shows **average turnaround** and **waiting time**

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Page structure
* **CSS** – Responsive, clean UI styling
* **JavaScript** – Logic for SJF scheduling and dynamic DOM updates
